### answer ###
Based on the data provided, we can analyze the strength and weakness of different fields in terms of their involvement in innovation activities. Here is a comparison of the fields:

### Strengths:

1. **Information and Communication**:
   - Highest average share of enterprises involved in innovation activities (27.20%).
   - Strong focus on innovation likely due to rapid technological advancements and demand for cutting-edge solutions.

2. **Professional, Scientific, and Technical Activities**:
   - Following closely with an innovation involvement of 26.79%.
   - This sector relies heavily on research and development, driving innovation.

3. **Manufacturing**:
   - With 26.77% involvement, it shows significant engagement in innovation.
   - Critical for product development and improving production processes.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Transportation and Storage**:
   - Lowest in innovation activities, with only 10.10%.
   - Could indicate a need for modernization or increased investment in innovative practices.

2. **Water Supply, Sewerage, Waste Management**:
   - Second lowest at 14.93%.
   - Often constrained by regulatory and infrastructure challenges, affecting agility in innovation.

3. **Financial and Insurance Activities**:
   - Low engagement in innovation (16.23%).
   - While traditionally risk-averse, there may be opportunities for growth through technology adoption and process improvements.

4. **Mining and Quarrying**:
   - With only 17.79%, innovation activities are limited, potentially due to high capital requirements and slower adoption of technology.

Overall, sectors with higher innovation rates are those closely tied with technological evolution and those reliant on continuous development, like Information and Communication, and Professional, Scientific, and Technical Activities. Conversely, industries like Transportation and Storage, and Water Supply face more challenges perhaps due to logistical, regulatory, or market-specific constraints.
